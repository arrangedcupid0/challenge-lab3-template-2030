# Challenge Lab 3

I wrote this assignment for my Data Structures lab for them to gain extra credit points. The compiled driver.o file contains driver code that accepts functions written by the user and runs them on user-provided inputs. The first function is meant to be a hash function, the second function is focused on code optimization, and the third function is supposed to be an optimized sorting function. If the user can beat my corresponding functions, two of which are straight out of the STL library, they win.
